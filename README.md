## Troubled

on linux

```sh
[12419:0602/204432.273114:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that ./node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
```

[reference](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972)ã€‚

```sh
sudo chown root your_path/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 your_path/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
```

or

```sh
sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```
